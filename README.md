### 🌍 **Domain & Hosting** 🌐
For this project, I chose to host the website using **GitHub Pages**, a free hosting service that allows deployment of static websites directly from a repository. I used a **GitHub subdomain** as it provides a simple and effective solution without the need for a paid domain.

The setup process involved:
- Configuring the repository ⚙️
- Enabling **GitHub Pages** 🔧
- Ensuring that the `index.html` file was placed in the root directory (or the designated branch) 🗂️

### 🛠️ **Website Setup** 
The website was developed using basic web technologies:

#### **HTML** 📝
I structured the website using HTML elements such as:
- Headings 🔠
- Paragraphs 📜
- Lists 📋

This ensured that the content was organized and easily accessible.

#### **CSS** 🎨
Styling was applied using CSS, which included:
- Background colors 🎨
- Font selection 🖋️
- A responsive container to ensure a clean and functional layout 📱

### 🌐 **Networking Aspects** 📡
In order to make the website accessible online, I applied several networking concepts:

#### **Domain Name System (DNS)** 📡
- By using **GitHub Pages**, the website is automatically mapped to a GitHub-provided URL 🌍.

#### **IP Addresses** 🌐
Websites are accessed through their associated IP addresses 🖧. In this case, GitHub Pages resolves the domain to GitHub’s IP addresses, allowing users to reach the website.

#### **Networking Protocols** 📶
Several protocols were used in making the website available:
- **HTTP/HTTPS**: Ensures secure data transfer 🔒.
- **TCP/IP**: Facilitates communication between the browser and GitHub’s servers 🔄.
- **DNS Protocol**: Resolves the domain to an IP address 🌐.

This project provided valuable experience with **web development**, **hosting**, and **networking** principles.
