💻 Computer Network Project 1 🌐

🌍 Domain & Hosting 🌐
For this project, I chose to host the website using GitHub Pages, a free hosting service that allows deployment of static websites directly from a repository. I used a GitHub subdomain (e.g., myusername.github.io) as it provides a simple and effective solution without the need for a paid domain.

The setup process involved:

Configuring the repository ⚙️
Enabling GitHub Pages 🔧
Ensuring that the index.html file was placed in the root directory (or the designated branch) 🗂️
🛠️ Website Setup
The website was developed using basic web technologies:

HTML 📝

I structured the website using HTML elements such as:

Headings 🔠
Paragraphs 📜
Lists 📋
This ensured that the content was organized and easily accessible.

CSS 🎨

Styling was applied using CSS, which included:

Background colors 🎨
Font selection 🖋️
A responsive container to ensure a clean and functional layout 📱
JavaScript (optional) ⚡

Although JavaScript was not included in this version of the website, I plan to incorporate interactive features in future updates.

🌐 Networking Aspects 📡
In order to make the website accessible online, I applied several networking concepts:

Domain Name System (DNS) 📡

By using GitHub Pages, the website is automatically mapped to a GitHub-provided URL 🌍.
For a custom domain, I could configure a CNAME record in the DNS settings to point to the GitHub Pages site 🏠.
Relevant DNS records:

A Record: Used when pointing a custom domain to an IP address 🌍.
CNAME Record: Points a subdomain (e.g., www.example.com) to the GitHub Pages site 🔗.
IP Addresses 🌐

Websites are accessed through their associated IP addresses 🖧. In this case, GitHub Pages resolves the domain to GitHub’s IP addresses, allowing users to reach the website.

Networking Protocols 📶

Several protocols were used in making the website available:

HTTP/HTTPS: Ensures secure data transfer 🔒.
TCP/IP: Facilitates communication between the browser and GitHub’s servers 🔄.
DNS Protocol: Resolves the domain to an IP address 🌐.
This project provided valuable experience with web development, hosting, and networking principles 🖥️🌐.
