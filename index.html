        <h1>Computer Network Project 1</h1>

        <h2> Author</h2>
        <p> Justice Gauldin</p>
        
        <h2>Domain & Hosting</h2>
        <p>For this project, I chose to host my website using GitHub Pages, a free and easy-to-use hosting service that allows me to deploy static websites directly from a repository. I used a GitHub subdomain (e.g., myusername.github.io) since it provided a simple and effective solution without requiring a paid domain.</p>
        <p>Setting up the domain involved configuring my repository, enabling GitHub Pages, and ensuring that my index.html file was properly placed in the root directory or the designated branch.</p>
        
        <h2>Website Setup</h2>
        <p>I built this website using HTML for the structure, CSS for styling, and kept it simple without additional frameworks. Here’s how I approached the development:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>HTML:</strong> I structured the webpage using elements like headings, paragraphs, and lists to organize the content logically.</li>
            <li><strong>CSS:</strong> I applied basic styling, including background colors, font choices, and a responsive container for a clean layout.</li>
            <li><strong>JavaScript (optional):</strong> Though not included here, I considered adding JavaScript for interactive features in the future.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Networking Aspects</h2>
        <p>Making my site accessible online required an understanding of key networking concepts. Here’s how they played a role:</p>
        
        <h3>Domain Name System (DNS)</h3>
        <p>Since I used GitHub Pages, my website’s domain was automatically mapped to a GitHub-provided URL. If I wanted a custom domain, I could configure a CNAME record in the DNS settings to point to my GitHub-hosted site.</p>
        <p>Common DNS records that could be relevant include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>A Record:</strong> Used if I were pointing a custom domain to an IP address.</li>
            <li><strong>CNAME Record:</strong> Directs a subdomain (e.g., www.example.com) to my GitHub Pages site.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>IP Addresses</h3>
        <p>Each website is accessed via an IP address, even if users type a domain name. My site, hosted on GitHub Pages, resolves to GitHub’s IP addresses, ensuring that visitors can reach my content.</p>
        
        <h3>Networking Protocols</h3>
        <p>Several protocols were involved in making my site available:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>HTTP/HTTPS:</strong> My site is accessible over HTTPS, ensuring secure data transfer.</li>
            <li><strong>TCP/IP:</strong> This protocol suite enables communication between my browser and GitHub’s servers.</li>
            <li><strong>DNS Protocol:</strong> Translates my GitHub Pages domain into an IP address.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>By setting up this website, I gained hands-on experience with hosting, networking concepts, and web development fundamentals.</p>
